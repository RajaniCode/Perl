Why make yet another blog?
	Why not? I am not pleased with wordpress due to its lack of caching. It can't hold up to a good old slashdotting! This blog takes advantage of extensive caching to benefit load times. I am tired of blogs going down due to high traffic! I want something that looks nice, pleasant to use and easy to deploy. 

What makes this blog so special?
	Fast,Free,Feature-full and easily deployable. Need I say more?
