Who is this release for?
	Skillful users and developers who might be interested in contributing. 

Why make yet another blog?
	Why not? I am not pleased with wordpress due to its lack of caching. It can't hold up to a good old slashdotting! This blog takes advantage of caching through out to minimize server resource usage and produce the best visit/connection throughout put. The other reason I made this was to learn the wonderful Catalyst web framework.  

What makes this blog so special?
	This blog is geared toward developers who wish to blog about their development cycle! I am completely gearing this toward the OSS developer demographic. This blog makes it easy at conveying your thoughts and ideas by posting syntax highlighted code snippets. Second of all, Caching Caching and some more caching! Almost every page is cached, for the best performance possible!
